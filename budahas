<h3>History of the Bamiyan Buddhas:</h3>
<li>The smaller Buddha, pictured here, stood about 38 meters (125 feet) tall. It was carved from the mountainside around 550 CE, according to radiocarbon dating. To the east, the larger Buddha stood some 55 meters (180 feet) high, and was carved a bit later, likely around 615 CE. Each Buddha stood in a niche, still attached to the back wall along their robes, but with free-standing feet and legs so that pilgrims could circumambulate around them.</li>
<h3>Attacks on the Buddha's statue:</h3>
<li>In 1221, with the advent of Genghis Khan, "a terrible disaster befell Bamiyan".Nevertheless, the statues were spared. The Mughal founder Babur wrote in September 1528 that he ordered both be destroyed.Later, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. The legs of the Buddhas were broken because of Aurangzeb's action.Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king Nader Afshar, directing cannon fire at them.</li>
<h3>Mural paintings:</h3>
<li>The Buddhas are surrounded by numerous caves and surfaces decorated with paintings.It is thought that the period of florescence was from the 6th to 8th century CE, until the onset of Islamic invasions.</li>

<blockquote>
"In 2008, Bamyan was found to be the home of the world's oldest oil paintings. At the end of the 10th century, there was a Buddhist culture in which several thousand Buddhist monks lived in caves carved into the mountain"
